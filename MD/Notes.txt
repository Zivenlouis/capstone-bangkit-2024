TODO :

Not Done:
- Logic / BackEnd : 
	- Model 2 User Clicks & Ratings
	- Detail Phone Pages (70 % - new arrivals , wishlist, edit profile ,reset password , forum , result page)
	- Delete forum
	- Save to History (Local Database) (from button Result Activity)
	- Recommended For You (in Home Fragment)

- UI :
 	- Like Button Logic
	- Auto Update UI profileactivity page after edit profile
	- Auto Update UI ForumFragment page after add post 
	- Questionnare Page slow response when move to InferenceLoading (maybe for fetching data it should be directly from inferenceloading page)

Minor Detail Flaws:
- Localize not created
- Hardcoded String
- Less detailed  due to design using Emulator Pixel 4 API 28
- Phone Mockup PNG only 1
- Loading Bar / Progress Bar Logic using animation
- Apps can run in API android 12 + upto newest one
- Clean Code & Clear Logic
